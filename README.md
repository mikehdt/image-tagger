This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project using React, Redux and TypeScript. Package management is handled with `pnpm`.

## Project Overview

This project allows the user to manage and tag image collections. Users can view images in a paginated gallery, add/edit/reorder tags for each image, filter images by tags, dimensions, or filetype, and save tags back to associated text files.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## All the Vibes

I started coding this by hand with the goal of initially trying to do things only with React state, then once that became unwieldy, Redux Toolkit, and then once I forgot what I was doing I decided to try GitHub Copilot just for interest in whether any of this LLM coding malarkey was justified in its hype. That said, most of what I've done recently was heavily written by Claude 3.7 and 4.0 via GH Copilot.

It's been an interesting journey. If I was a cooler person I might have livestreamed the sessions as there have been surprising outcomes both good and extremely head-scratching as sometimes it does things really well, sometimes it goes completely off the deep end and then keeps digging.
